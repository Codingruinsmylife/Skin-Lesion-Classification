# Skin-Lesion-Classification
Theis project on skin lesion classification using deep learning involves developing a robust model to accurately diagnose various skin conditions from image inputs. The primary objective is to classify skin lesions into multiple categories, including both benign and malignant types, using a deep learning techniques. The project entails collecting and preprocessing a comprehensive dataset of labeled skin lesion images, followed by implementing a deep learning architecture, such as ResNet-50, to learn and distinguish between different lesion types. Advanced techniques like data augmentation and class balancing are employed to enhance model performance and generalization. The model is trained and fine-tuned to achieve high accuracy, and its efficacy is evaluated through rigorous testing. The ultimate goal is to provide a reliable tool for dermatologists, aiding in early and precise diagnosis of skin diseases, potentially improving patient outcomes through timely medical intervention.

## Overview
The skin lesion classification project aims to develop a sophisticated deep learning model to accurately diagnose various skin conditions from image inputs. Utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, specifically ResNet-50, the model is trained on a diverse dataset of labeled skin lesion images to classify lesions into multiple categories, including benign and malignant types. The project involves extensive data preparation, including combining images from different sources, data augmentation, and class balancing, to enhance the model's performance. The workflow encompasses importing necessary libraries, mounting Google Drive for data access, preprocessing images, and training the model with fine-tuning for optimal accuracy. The ultimate goal is to provide a reliable and automated tool for dermatologists, aiding in the early detection and precise diagnosis of skin diseases, thereby improving diagnostic efficiency and patient outcomes in clinical settings.
